<h2>Tl;DR</h2>
During this course I learned and applied the basics of html, css and js to make this website, 
obviously it might be lacking in a few areas but I belive I did a pretty nice job for my first website.

<h1>Overview</h1><br>
In this assignment, we had to demonstrate our mastery of the following course outcomes:

Combine current and appropriate technological standards of HTML and CSS for designing and implementing a fully functional website
Employ industry-standard file naming conventions and formats for uploading and delivering web-based content
Employ the basics of HTML editing applications and FTP applications in the testing and editing of web-based content
Create a functionally aesthetic user interface through the application of user experience principles

<h1>Prompt</h1><br>
For this project, you will design and build a functioning and compliant website using HTML and CSS. Your design and build will be based upon one of the brand style guides provided to you.

The final website requirements are as follows:

Website pages: For the final website, you should have at least the five following pages: home page (index.html), menu page (menu.html), 
about page (about.html), contact page (contact.html), and CSS stylesheet (stylesheet.css).

All HTML pages should have the following: restaurant logo (clickable to home page), navigation bar (all HTML pages listed with a hover stage defined), 
and footer (business name, address, phone number, social media links, and copyright).

**Home page** (index.html): Include the dominant image, secondary content (features/teasers for promos, entree features, events, etc.), 
and secondary images (about half the size of the dominant image). Use at least the h1 tag and include a mission statement.
  
**Menu page** (menu.html): Include the dominant image and your content (menu teaser showcasing some items, if not a full menu). Use at least the h1 tag.
  
**About page** (about.html): Include the dominant image, a vision statement, and other possible content (history, information about the chef, and so on). Use at least the h1 tag.
  
**Contact page** (contact.html): Include the business name, address, phone number, social media icons and links, business hours, and other possible content (map, customer contact form).
  
**CSS stylesheet** (stylesheet.css): Define all tags used, including font name, font size, and element color: h1, h2, h3, p, ul, li, navigation links, including hover stage.
  
Colors: Use the primary and secondary colors from the restaurant’s brand style guide.
  
Fonts: You must use the fonts from the style guide, Town Restaurant (Athelas and Majesti Banner) and Pasta Amore (Klinic Slab and Goudy Old Style). 
 For Majesti Banner and Klinic Slab, you must place font files in the CSS folder and use the @fontface tag to apply style to tags. 
 For Athelas, you must link to Adobe CSS stylesheet in the head. (See code from link Add to web project.) 
 For Goudy Old Style, link to Adobe CSS stylesheet in the head section. (See code from link Add to web project.)
Images: All images should have the alt tag included for SEO. They should be placed in your “images” folder to be linked and should be saved for web size (less than 500 KB).
 
 <h1></h1><br>
Specifically, you must address the critical elements listed below.<br>

**Design Structure**: Design and implement an overall design structure for website design. Your design structure must demonstrate the following:
The website contains all the pages outlined (home, menu, about, and contact pages) from the sitemap to convey the overall complexity and depth of a website.
The website has an engaging overall design that includes a good hierarchy structure with placement of content, including header and text sizes 
and photos (primary and secondary) with a good balance.
Appropriate image formats and other media types are collected and incorporated in a standard HTML document, appropriately named and saved for the web.

**Visual Elements** : Control the visual elements in an HTML document by using CSS standard formatting. Visual elements must demonstrate the following:
The website design contains the elements (restaurant logo, navigation, main content, secondary content and footer) from the wireframe sketches for the website’s structure 
and element placement.The website design contains the appropriate typographic hierarchy of text elements on the page, including the h1 tag and the fonts from the brand style guide.
Control the positioning and scale of graphical page elements on the website, including a dominant photo.Use an external CSS style sheet appropriately to control the website’s formatting. 
This style sheet will capture the hierarchy and graphical page elements noted above.

<br>

  **Homepage**: Create a compliant HTML homepage using correct HTML tags and formatting. Your homepage must demonstrate the following:
The website has compliant page formatting with standard HTML. Your code should contain these elements: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html> (language defined), 
head (with meta and title), and body tags. Implement industry-standard naming conventions for HTML pages and photos and file-management techniques for setting up the website’s root folder.
The homepage design is hand-coded using an industry-standard HTML editor with clean code. 
The page should contain the following: a logo, a navigation bar, a dominant image, the h1 tag, secondary content, and a footer.
  
<br>
  
  **Navigation** : Create navigational elements and layout in an HTML document by using advanced CSS standard formatting. Navigational elements must demonstrate the following:
Navigational elements are designed and formatted by applying appropriate CSS rules to the unordered list tags on all pages.
HTML elements of unordered lists are styled using brand guide colors, fonts, background color, removing text-decoration and hover stage based on your wireframes.
All HTML pages are linked using standard HTML tags to create a cohesive user experience.
File structure is optimized, utilizing industry-standard file-management practices for all HTML pages.
An effective user interface is created based on placement of the navigation on your website where the user is expecting to find it on all HTML pages.

  **Uploading**: Upload your website and browser testing pages to Brightspace.
Upload your properly zipped root folder to Brightspace, including all properly named HTML and font files as well as “images” and “css” folders with files.
Upload three browser screenshots of website page content and layouts from testing (either the JPEGs in a zipped folder or images placed in a Word document).
